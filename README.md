# Excel-Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of projects where I utilized Microsoft Excel to clean and manipulate data, effectively summarize and present data in reports, and create interactive data visualizations. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in Excel and my ability to utilize its features for effective data analysis and visualization of business metrics.

These datasets are found publicly on data.gov, mavenanalytics.io/data-playground, and kaggle.com
